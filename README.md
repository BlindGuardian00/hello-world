# hello-world
This is my first project on Github. I created this for CS3300 at UCCS.

Hey, my name is Daniel, and I have way too many interests to know much about any of them. These include: the Japanese language, video games (especially story-driven RPGs), clay sculpting, drums, Hebrew language (biblical Hebrew), fantasy novels (definitely check out Battle Mage by Peter Flannery), listening to fantasy-themed power metal (e.g., Blind Guardian), and co-op games with my brother (recently Stardew Valley has been our jam).
